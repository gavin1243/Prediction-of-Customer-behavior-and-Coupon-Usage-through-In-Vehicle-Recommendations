# Prediction of Customer behavior and Coupon Usage through In-Vehicle Recommendations

# Introduction
When we purchase things online, we often look for discount coupons and finding the most appropriate one is hard to find. By predicting whether the customer would accept a discount coupon or not, we could reduce the marketing costs for these businesses as they would only show these discounts to people who are more likely to use them. Using this project, we are trying to build a classification model which would predict whether a customer would accept a coupon recommendation or not.
# Model Implementation
The models used here are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks.
